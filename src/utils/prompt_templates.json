    "description": "Create a knowledge graph of key terms for any given topic",
    "template": "Conduct an exhaustive domain analysis of [SPECIFIC TOPIC HERE], identifying its core ontological concepts, primary sub-domains, and the foundational theories or principles underpinning each. For each identified sub-domain, provide a concise definition, list at least three key terms or concepts unique to it, and propose a conceptual mapping that illustrates its relationship to the main topic and other sub-domains. The output should be structured as a hierarchical knowledge graph, accompanied by a narrative summary explaining the interdependencies and emergent properties of the domain."

    "template": "Perform a comprehensive landscape scan of [SPECIFIC TOPIC HERE], delineating its historical evolution, current state-of-the-art, and projected future trajectories. For each temporal phase (past, present, future), identify the most significant breakthroughs, influential figures or organizations, and prevalent methodologies or technologies. Systematically extract and define at least five critical jargon terms or technical concepts associated with each phase. Conclude with a 'Domain Surface Area Map' that categorizes these terms based on their relevance to different aspects (e.g., technical, theoretical, ethical, application) of the topic, highlighting areas of active research and potential disruption."

For each identified impact category (e.g., privacy, equity, employment, environmental), delineate specific manifestations of the impact, provide illustrative real-world examples (if applicable), and list at least three key ethical frameworks or societal principles (e.g., fairness, autonomy, transparency) most relevant to its analysis. The output should be structured as a 'Risk-Benefit Matrix' with associated ethical considerations, accompanied by a narrative explaining the normative trade-offs and areas requiring policy or regulatory attention."

    "template": "Perform a detailed application and implementation analysis of [SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY/METHODOLOGY HERE], identifying its core use cases, practical implementation challenges, and the ecosystem of tools or platforms that support its deployment. For each primary use case, describe its typical workflow, specify the prerequisite technical infrastructure or data requirements, and list at least three key performance indicators (KPIs) or success metrics used to evaluate its effectiveness. Conclude with an 'Implementation Readiness Map' that categorizes the identified challenges (e.g., technical, data quality, integration, user adoption) and proposes initial mitigation strategies, providing a clear roadmap for practical application."

For each major regulatory area (e.g., data protection, consumer safety, intellectual property, antitrust), detail its core provisions or mandates, specify the entities responsible for enforcement, and list at least three critical compliance requirements or legal obligations for participants in the domain. Conclude with a 'Regulatory Compliance Framework' that maps legal terms and obligations to specific operational areas, highlighting areas of regulatory uncertainty or upcoming legislative changes, providing a clear understanding of the legal 'surface area'."
